                            <p>We don't want to waste a single one of your clients appointments we've booked for you.<br>
                                These appointments are a genuine deal already half-made for you. But we want the client  appointment to transform into a sale.<br>
                                So, with some of leading gyms  we've developed an intelligent sales process designed to take each high-grade appointment from inspection to closed deal.<br>
                                The process is simple for your colleagues to do on the day.<br>
                                And it's persuasive without being pushy. Instead of winging it during the inspection, follow our proven steps and see how much easier it is to close more deals.</p>

                  <p>But it isn't only us who think so
                    We have dozens of verified written and video testimonials from real fitness company owners.
                    They confirm that the leads they get from us are unique, low-cost - and, because they're actually  gym inspection appointments, are much, much easier to convert into paying customers.
                    ModernMonk customers agree that our leads are:
                    cheaper to buy 
                    quicker to close and 
                    more reliable to supply
                    than anything they achieved via Google ads, website leads 
                    business owners have used our services to turn medium businesses into large businesses - and large businesses into top fitness companies.
                    We're experts at providing fitness companies with easy to close leads because that's all we do. We do not work for any other industry. 
                    If you are a fitness company owner in the USA, Canada,Australia,Europe ,India we can do for you what we've done for them. And you'll notice the difference from the very first week.

                  <p>It takes us roughly 5 working days to get things set up for you and then we start running your ads. Results - in the form of booked appointments - can appear the first day your ads run. Although we would expect it to take a few days before the specific set-up we've created for you finally beds in. 

                    From there, we refine your ads as results come in, looking for small improvements in order to increase overall results. That can take 3 - 4 weeks. But you'll be getting appointments in the meantime - and we'll be aiming to run the size of campaign necessary to keep your company fully busy throughout. You need to be able to handle the increased appointments and orders before we begin your ad campaign.</p>

                  <p>Different platforms work very differently for residential roofing companies. Some are incredibly competitive and very expensive - Google ads, especially. Others barely work at all - Instagram, for example. 

                    We know this from experience.
                    
                    But when it comes to finding exclusive leads for residential roofing companies we know exactly what works - and that's Facebook. 
                    
                    In terms of quality of lead and cost Facebook has been our undisputed champion for appointment generation since 2017. 
                    
                    And because we only use Facebook and we only work with residential roofing companies… we've developed a lead generation expertise that is unbeatable.
                    
                    Because using Facebook's powerful audience tools we can pinpoint audiences in super-fine detail - and then get our clients actual roofing inspection appointments for as little as $100. 
                    
                    In a small number of cases we've got lead costs down to under $10 - and booked appointments with new buyers for $25. 
                    
                    Facebook makes this possible - if you really know how to use it. And being expert Facebook advertisers means we have helped hundreds of residential roofing customers add millions of dollars each to their annual revenues. 
                    
                    Until some other platform comes along that can outdo Facebook we're going to stick with it. It works!</p>

                    In the past, the new flow of customers has overwhelmed smaller companies and they've had to switch off their campaigns while they try to handle the new workflow. Which means they stop using our services until they work out how to run their own business.
                    
                    We need companies who can handle the increase in business and keep the revenues flowing. 
                    
                    Larger businesses - those that have exceeded the $500k mark - have already worked out how to handle larger volumes of work. Their processes are more robust. They have good people in place. 
                    
                    For them, handling a fairly sudden uplift in business is a matter of expanding what they already do - rather than having to learn it all from scratch. 
                    
                    No matter where you operate the business is all there. We want to work with clients who can handle it. </p>

                    Before we take on a new client we make sure they're right for us. In other words we first qualify them (just like we qualify new clients for you).
                    
                    Part of that qualification is: do we already have a client in the area you operate in?
                    
                    We routinely refuse to take on clients because their business competes with an existing client's business. 
                    
                    So rest assured: if you are our client then we will not take on a new client in your area of operation. </p>

                  <p>'Some' success is nice. But we're looking for constant, ongoing success. We give our clients a reliable flow of new business so they can pursue exciting commercial goals.  

                    Most agencies of course mean well and they want to help you do well. 
                    
                    The problem with almost every lead generation agency? They're generalists. They rarely - or never - specialise. They work with anyone and they'll do anything for them. 
                    
                    Years ago we worked in generalist agencies where, in a given month, clients included real estate agents, beauticians, personal trainers, dentists, dog groomers, kitchen designers, lawyers, fast food restaurants, hairdressers, accountants, drainage firms… 
                    
                    We could never build up a deep understanding of the real-world challenges faced by companies in these industries. Because we were forever switching from one industry to another. 
                    
                    All we ever did was apply a one-size-fits-all approach to every customer. Regardless of industry or the specific or unique challenges a company faced we just did the same thing for everyone. 
                    
                    We got lucky with some companies and got them some sales. 
                    
                    But as soon as they wanted steady, reliable growth that they could count on… we couldn't help. We didn't know how to. So their revenues plateaued and they stayed stuck.
                    We're specialists in the very industry and in the very difficulties you face every day. </p>

                  <p>Leads aren't free so they represent a cost of doing business. Nothing surprising about that. But not all leads are equal and some eat into your profit margins more than others.

                    If you're getting leads from one channel at $300 to $400 each and converting one out of five into orders then you're paying $1500 - $2000 per new sale. 
                    
                    You'll have to factor that into your pricing. 
                    
                    If your sales are coming in at $100 - $350 each… which they generally will be then you can better judge where your marketing dollars need to be spent. It's easier to know what your profit margins are likely to be when you know what your leads costs are. </p>
